# DICE Model for Brazil: Economic and Climate Prediction

This repository contains a modified version of the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (DICE) specifically tailored to model economic and climate impacts in Brazil. The model incorporates Brazil-specific data, including initial economic indicators and climate impact factors, to simulate the effects of economic growth and climate change on Brazil's economy.

## Introduction

The DICE model is a well-known tool for understanding the relationship between economic growth and climate change. In this customized version, we have integrated Brazil-specific data, making it possible to simulate the impact of climate policies, economic decisions, and environmental changes specifically on Brazil's economy.

## Model Overview

The model predicts the following key metrics over a specified time horizon:
- **Capital Stock (K)**: Represents Brazil's capital stock over time.
- **Consumption (C)**: Brazil’s annual consumption, adjusted for climate damages.
- **Economic Output (Y)**: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Brazil based on a Cobb-Douglas production function.
- **Damages (D)**: Economic damages due to climate-related impacts.

The model uses a Cobb-Douglas production function and a damage function that reflects Brazil's specific emissions data.

## Brazil-Specific Adjustments

The following parameters have been customized for Brazil:
- **Initial Economic Values**: Includes initial values for Brazil's GDP, capital stock, and labor force.
- **Damage Coefficient**: Reflects Brazil’s carbon intensity and climate sensitivity.
- **Labor Growth Rate**: Based on Brazil’s historical and projected workforce growth.

These parameters can be updated as new data becomes available to ensure accurate predictions.
